### 1. (ROS 1.2) 4 points

Sketch (or simulate and plot) hypothetical data with:

a. x in the range of 0 to 4 percent corresponding to the regression line with y = 30 + 10 x, with residual standard deviation of 3.9
b. x in the range of 0 to 4 percent corresponding to the regression line with y = 30 + 10 x, with residual standard deviation of 10

### 2. (ROS 1.3) 3 points

Propose a situation where you might

1. Fit a regression model to estimate a relationship of interest
2. Use a regression model to adjust for differences between treatment and control groups
3. Use a regression model to make predictions.

### 3. (ROS 1.4) 2 points

Give examples of applied statistics problems of interest to you in which there are challenges in

1. Generalizing from a sample to population
2. Generalizing from a treatment to a control group

### 4. (ROS 1.9) 4 points

Consider the helicopter design experiment in Exercise 1.1. Suppose you were to construct 25 helicopters, measure their falling times, fit a linear model predicting that the outcome given wing width and body length:

time = &beta<sub>0</sub> +&beta<sub>1</sub> * width + &beta<sub>2</sub> length + error

then use the fitted model:

time = &beta<sub>0</sub> +&beta<sub>1</sub> * width + &beta<sub>2</sub> length

to estimate the values of wing width and body length that will maximize expected time aloft.

a. Using the constraint of width between 0.91 and 2.75 inches, and length of 0 to 5.5 inches, what values will be selected for width and length (You can assume that &beta<sub>1</sub> > 0 and &beta<sub>2</sub> > 0 ?

b. Assume that the falling time depends on a relationship _between_ wing width and wing length. How can this be captured in a regression model? Either text or equations are an acceptable answer.
